## The Problem: Students Struggle with AI Transparency

### Key Statistics (2024-2025)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Students using AI regularly | **92%** (up from 66% in 2024) | [HEPI 2025](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/reports/student-generative-ai-survey-2025/) |
| Students using AI for tests | **88%** (up from 53% in 2024) | [Programs.com](https://programs.com/resources/students-using-ai/) |
| Students who FAIL to disclose AI use | **74%** | [King's Business School](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2024.2415654) |
| Schools with AI policies | **58%** | [BestColleges](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-college-students-have-used-ai-survey/) |
| Teachers reporting AI-related trouble | **63%** | [EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org/technology/new-data-reveal-how-many-students-are-using-ai-to-cheat/2024/04) |
| AI-generated citations that are wrong/fake | **47%** | [University of Mississippi Study](https://originality.ai/blog/ai-hallucination-factual-error-problems) |

### Why Students Don't Disclose (Even When Required)

> "Mandatory disclosure statements feel like a confession or admission of guilt"
> — [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/10/28/case-against-ai-disclosure-statements-opinion)

**Root Causes:**
1. Disclosure feels like admitting wrongdoing
2. No easy tool to generate statements
3. Uncertainty about what to include
4. Fear of being flagged by AI detection
5. Inconsistent policies across courses

---

## University Requirements (Growing Trend)

### Universities WITH Mandatory Disclosure

| University | Policy |
|------------|--------|
| **Princeton** | Must disclose AI use, keep chat logs |
| **Oxford** | Transparency required, summative only with permission |
| **MIT** | Department-specific, disclosure expected |
| **Duke** | Unauthorized AI = cheating under Community Standard |
| **Peking University** | Penalties include degree revocation |

### What Students Must Disclose

Per [Princeton Guidelines](https://libguides.princeton.edu/generativeAI/disclosure):
- Which AI tool was used
- Purpose of AI assistance
- How output was integrated
- Prompts used (sometimes)

## Current Solutions & Their Limitations

### 1. Grammarly Authorship

**What it does:** Tracks writing process, shows % original vs AI
**Limitations:**
- Only works if you write IN Grammarly
- Doesn't help if you used ChatGPT/Claude directly
- TRACKS usage, doesn't GENERATE disclosure statements
- Doesn't coach on prompt quality

### 2. University Templates

**What they provide:** Fill-in-the-blank Word docs
**Limitations:**
- Tedious to complete
- 74% of students skip them
- No standardization across institutions
- No formatting for APA/MLA/Chicago

[Example: Newman University Template](https://newmanu.libguides.com/ai-disclosure)

### 3. Citation Generators (MyBib, Scribbr, etc.)

**What they do:** Generate citations for sources
**Limitations:**
- Don't generate AI disclosure statements
- Can't verify if AI-generated citations are real
- No prompt coaching

[Source: MyBib](https://www.mybib.com)

### 4. AI Detection Tools (Turnitin, GPTZero)

**What they do:** Detect AI-generated content
**Limitations:**
- Adversarial to students
- High false positive rates
- Universities abandoning them
- Don't help students use AI properly

## Market Gap Analysis

| Need | Existing Solution | Gap |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Generate AI disclosure statements | Manual templates | **NO AUTOMATED TOOL** |
| Score prompt quality | Generic tools, not student-focused | **NO STUDENT-FOCUSED TOOL** |
| Verify AI citations are real | Manual checking | **NO EASY TOOL** |
| Track AI contributions | Grammarly Authorship | Only works in Grammarly |
| Research with real sources | Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar | **NOT INTEGRATED WITH DISCLOSURE** |

### Critical Finding

**There is NO tool that:**
1. Generates professional AI disclosure statements automatically
2. Formats them in APA/MLA/Chicago
3. Coaches students on writing better prompts
4. Helps verify AI-generated information

## Student Pain Points (Research Summary)

### Writing & Research Struggles

| Pain Point | Percentage | Source |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Time constraints for drafting/revision | High | [Publishing State](https://publishingstate.com/challenges-in-academic-writing/2024/) |
| Fear and anxiety about AI use | Common | Academic research |
| Getting poor results from AI | 53% concerned about accuracy | [Chegg Survey](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-college-students-have-used-ai-survey/) |
| AI hallucinations/fake citations | 47% error rate | [U of Mississippi](https://originality.ai/blog/ai-hallucination-factual-error-problems) |

### AI Usage Struggles

From [Harvard GSE Research](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/09/students-are-using-ai-already-heres-what-they-think-adults-should-know):

1. **Overreliance** - Fear of undermining own abilities
2. **"Fixation of mind"** - Hard to think independently after seeing AI output
3. **Loss of productive struggle** - Missing learning opportunities
4. **Verification burden** - Must check everything AI generates

### What Students Actually Want

From [MDPI Research](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/14/10/1062):
- Language suggestions & grammar checks
- Paraphrasing & summarization
- **Citation management**
- **Source integration while writing**
- AI thesis builders for outlines

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors: NONE

No tool specifically generates AI disclosure statements for students.

### Adjacent Competitors

| Tool | Category | Threat Level |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Grammarly | Writing assistant | LOW (different use case) |
| QuillBot | Paraphrasing | LOW (no disclosure feature) |
| Turnitin | Detection | NONE (we're pro-transparency) |
| GPTZero | Detection | NONE (adversarial positioning) |
| Elicit | Research | MEDIUM (research only) |

### Why Grammarly Won't Kill Us

1. **Different problem** - They track, we generate
2. **Lock-in** - Only works if you write in Grammarly
3. **Enterprise focus** - They're going after businesses
4. **No prompt coaching** - Not part of their roadmap

---

## Validation Verdict

### CIDI Score: 72/100

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Context** | 18/25 | Clear market gap, validated need |
| **Integrity** | 17/25 | Ethical positioning strengthens it |
| **Details** | 19/25 | Specific features, clear differentiation |
| **Instructions** | 18/25 | Actionable roadmap exists |

### Success Probability: 35-45%

**Higher than typical because:**
- No direct competitor
- Growing regulatory pressure
- Clear pain point
- Low-cost architecture

**Risks:**
- Students may not pay
- Grammarly could add feature
- Universities could provide free tools

---

## Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH BUILD**

The market gap is real, growing, and validated. No existing tool solves the specific problem of AI disclosure generation + prompt coaching for students.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. First-mover in AI disclosure generation
2. Student-focused (not enterprise)
3. Ethical positioning (transparency, not evasion)
4. Prompt coaching (educational value)
5. Free tier with generous limits
