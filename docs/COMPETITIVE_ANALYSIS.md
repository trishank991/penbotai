## Executive Summary: The Brutal Truth

**Core assumption revision required.** The AI disclosure and academic transparency market has matured faster than anticipated.

| Original Claim | Reality (Dec 2025) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "AI Disclosure Statement Generator (NO COMPETITORS)" | **FALSE** - GAIDeT Declaration Generator, Paperpal AI Disclosures, Grammarly Authorship all exist |
| "AI Citation Verifier (NO COMPETITORS)" | **FALSE** - Citea, SwanRef, GPTZero Source Finder, Citely all exist |
| "AI Prompt Coach (MINIMAL COMPETITION)" | **PARTIALLY TRUE** - Student-focused prompt coaching is sparse, but MagicSchool.ai and others serve educators |
| "First-mover in AI disclosure" | **FALSE** - Market has multiple entrants |

**Bottom Line:** ScholarSync must differentiate on bundle value and prompt coaching, not first-mover advantage.

## Kill Criteria (Unchanged)

- Month 12: < 50 paying users = kill

These remain appropriate given competitive pressure.

---

## Realistic Outcomes

### Best Case
- $5K MRR by Year 2 (1,000 paying users)
- Strong position in community college market
- Potential acquisition target for edtech company

### Worst Case
- Grammarly releases prompt coaching feature
- All differentiators disappear
- Hit kill criteria at Month 6

### Most Likely
- Sustainable niche in budget-conscious student market
- $2-3K MRR by Year 2
- Profitable lifestyle business, not venture-scale
