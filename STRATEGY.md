# ScholarSync - Ethical AI Learning Assistant for Students

> **📋 Master Document:** For the complete unified strategy including Student + Professional tiers, gamification, certifications, and full task tracking, see [MASTER_STRATEGY.md](MASTER_STRATEGY.md)

## Mission

Help students use AI responsibly, transparently, and effectively - not to cheat, but to learn better.

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** Universities now REQUIRE AI disclosure. The market has multiple tools, but none offer a complete student-focused bundle.

**The Positioning:** "The only all-in-one ethical AI toolkit for students" - NOT a Turnitin bypass tool.

**The Moat:** Bundle value (5 tools in 1) + unique prompt coaching + student-first pricing ($5/mo).

**The Cost:** $0/month until 10K users using free-tier architecture.

**Market Reality (Dec 2025):** See [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed competitor landscape. Key competitors include Grammarly Authorship, Turnitin Draft Coach, and Paperpal.

| Grammarly adds disclosure | 50% | Differentiate on prompt coaching |
| Regulation enforcement delayed | 20% | Position on productivity, not just compliance |
| Enterprise sales cycles too long | 50% | Focus on self-serve SMB |
| Students won't pay | High | Generous free tier, $5 is low |

---

## Kill Criteria

### Student Tier
- Month 6: < 500 users = pivot or kill
- Month 12: < 50 paying users = kill
- Year 2: < $1K MRR = kill

### Professional Tier (2026)
- Q2 2026: < $5K MRR = pivot approach
- Q4 2026: < $20K MRR = reconsider strategy
- End 2027: < $50K MRR = wind down professional tier
- Year 2: < $1K MRR = kill
